	Keep keys. Control the treasure. Minimize keys.

	Subsidies are for gathering support from blocks (in democracies) --
		diverging rewards for blocks that can be swayed.

	"Minimize keys" in democracy:
		- make it easier for your key blocks to vote,
		  harder for other blocks
		- have complex rules for who can even apply to be elected

	If you try to take the moral path, you'll be outcompeted by someone who
	does not.

	Taxes and revolts:
		Treasure is raised and spent to keep country together.
		More democracy => lower taxes.
			democracy: welfare for the poor sinks average tax rate down
			dictators: just take what they want
				dictators take produce from farmers for cheap,
				then sell on open market for more and pocket the
				difference
					=> much higher effective taxes

Lowering taxes is a crowd-pleaser.
For democracy: more productivity is better, because productive citizens create
	treasure.
--- Needs of power-holders happen to have incentives somewhat aligned with
	large groups of people.
(Dictators: needs aligned with just a few keys.)

This is the reason why oil, gold, etc. leads to dictatorships -- citizens may be
safely ignored.

Democracies are stable -- large amounts for keys. Dictatorial revolutions aren't
	feasible.

Dictatorships are stable -- less dictatorial dictators will be outcompeted.
