	non-violent communication: observation, feeling, need, request
	Non-violent Communication book and workshop

	when you're not OK with hearing "no", it's not a request

	avoid making important decisions when in the grip of emotions

	STI health - printed book has diagrams
		regular testing and prevention

		STIs are both more rare and more ubiquitous than most people imagine

	fluid bonding: ask to hear about instances of unbarriered sex

	herpes simplex virus

	what do I consider safe sex?

	"bar raiser" relationships (kind of game-changer)

	most attempts to engineer an outcome are coercion

	Relationships never end. They just change.

	Metamour relationships:
		compartmentalized: frequent with free agent/solo poly people
		networked: efforts to build friendships
			"polycule": poly + molecule
		poly family

	ktango: poly dating site
	okcupid: add Polyamory interest, make poly questions mandatory

	partner selection is a skill and is valuable;
		selected vs. by-default relationships

	dealbreakers?
		- sexual preferences?
		- history of violence?

		"fuck yes or no" -- 'ambivalence has little place in romance'

		"does this person have wisdom I find attractive?"
		etc.

	Mind the gap:
		the gap between who you are and what you'd like to be

		accept that you're not yet who you want to be and that it's OK
		to still need time or space to work through things,
		as long as you move in the right direction

		don't pretend to be your ideal self yet
