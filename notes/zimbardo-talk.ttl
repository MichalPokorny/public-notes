		Evil: what makes good people go wrong?
			in ghetto: men corrupt children
			temptation to do bad

			poverty is systemic evil
				TODO LINE-OF-INQUIRY: says "20% of all children now live and die in poverty, and it's increasing"
					really?

			what is the difference between people who give in to temptation vs.  resist?

			good/evil line is not fixed, evil is always a temptation
				psychological definition of evil:
					exercise of power to intentionally:
					* harm (psychologically),
					* hurt (physically),
					* destroy (mortally),
					* commit crimes against humanity (via genocide by nations)
				corporations:
					* fraud
					* corruption
					* bullying
					* indifference
					* willful blindness
			evil:
				* individual ("bad apples" -- "bad people")
				* situational (social and physical environment -- prison experiment)
				* systemic (organizational influences, political, economic, ...)

			Why do people turn evil?
				* dehumanization
				* diffusion of responsibility
				* obedience to authority
				* group pressure
				* anonymity/de-individuation

			China encourages people to smoke (54% of men smoke, 320M regularly)
				earning: 605M yuan
				prevents anti-smoking campaigns
				kill 1M men annually

				slogans -- Sichuan Tobacco Primary School
				"Ingenuity is the fruit of dilligence - tobacco will help you succeed."

			Systemi evils:
				* war
				* genocide
				* poverty
				* slave labor
				* sex trafficking
					- more profitable than drug trade
					- not prosecuted
					- $2000 to keep one alive, each makes $35000
				* climate change

			Shyness, 1977
			The Lucifer Effect, 2007
			The Time Paradox, 2008
			Man, Interrupted, 2016

			"On the demise of guys"
			Shyness is common and incresing. (Electronics are replacing people, face-to-face communication.)

			Fatherlessness:
				ripple effect: stressed mom -> elevated stress
				father gives extrinsic motivation to perform
				mothers "accept you whenever"

			Question: research into same-sex families? (line for inquiry)

			Time framing

			What is a hero?
				* acts on behalf of others in need or in defense of a moral cause
				* aware of risks to life, finances, or career
				* usually modest and humble, who usually disown the hero label

			New conception:
				DEMOCRATIZE: everyone can be a hero
				DEMYSTIFY: No special inner qualities or background are essential.
				DIFFUSE: Away from solo heroes to team or ensemble heroes in prosocial networks.

			Need for heroes:
				Shift social norm from passive compliance to pro-social action
				Put their best selves forward in service to humanity
				Represent ideas we can all aspire to

			Heroes: ordinary, everyday people whose actions in challenging situations are EXTRAORDINARY
				Rosa Parks

			How to be a hero that is effective and lives a long life.
				(Low-clearance - hero in New York subway was stupid, high-risk)

			Heroic Imagination Project - non-profit in San Francisco
				modules:
					Mindset (-- change to growth mindset. static mindset: prejudice imposed on myself)
					Situation Blindness
					Bystander Effect
					Conformity/Peer Pressure
					Adaptive Attributions & Stereotype Threat
					Prejudice and Intergroup Conflict

			- power of 1: be that person
			- power of 2: be an ally
			- power of many: "create hero squads"
			- dare to be different: practice being a "positive deviant"
			- act socially: act wisely, well and often
