	Sam Harris's interview with David Deutsch

	to understand this scum (life) entails understanding everything in the universe
		(knowledge grows)
		SETI project and champagne cork
		people are of UNIVERSAL significance; there is no other thing you need the whole universe to understand

	either something is precluded by laws of nature, or it is achievable given enough knowledge

	Deutsch: "humans have achieved cognitive escape philosophy"
		(vs. parochialism: evolution hasn't evolved us to understand the nature of reality)

	deutsch:
		- universality of computation
			caveats: lack of memory, lack of speed (one of these is
			the reason I can't persuade a chicken)

	the thing that would make better AIs would also make better people

	the lights aren't on in superintelligences:
