("Lying") :note """
	(by Sam Harris)

	to truly have integrity, we must not feel the need to lie about our personal lives

	How would your relationships change if you resolved never to lie again? What truths
	might suddenly come into view in your life? What kind of person would you become? And
	how might you change the people around you?
