	The first is that people may not have a good intuitive sense for how
	much sample size matters. When looking at means of a sample, the
	standard error decreases as square root of the sample size. So the
	standard error of a sample of size 16 (sqrt(16) = 4) is only half that
	of a sample of size 4 (sqrt(4) = 2). The standard error of a sample of
	size 100 is only half that of a sample of size 25.

	In the bias-variance tradeoff, the "ask 3 people" approach has higher
	variance, but I suspect the reduction in bias outweighs that.
