friendly: being nice to & interested in others, social: spending time with others and enjoying it

- start conversations with new people
- chat back to people who try to talk to you
- take time to talk to people you already know
- maintain your relationships and show you're interested in the other people
- invite people to do things with you/the group
	- be loose and generous with your invitations to people
	- be the one to invite them rather than waiting
- bring new people into the fold and make them feel included
- go to where people are
- spend more time with people
- if you only see some acquaintances of yours under specific circumstances
  (e.g., particular class/club), try to see them outside that situation
- make nice little gestures towards other people
	- bring food, do basic courtesies... (less is more)
- offer compliments; be positive and encouraging
