	Empathy in social situations and not coming off as insensitive
		emotional empathy vs. cognitive empathy

		benefit: you can generally get a sense of what people want out of an interaction
			you can adjust conversation style based on other person's personality

		less developed cognitive empathy/ability to consider other's perspectives:
			* offending people by making inappropriate jokes
			* **disregarding things that are important to other people**

		reasons people can come across as unsympathetic/insensitive:
			* not goot at caring about other people
			* don't know how to show concern/care (frustration/awkwardness)
			* people with asperger's syndrome (trouble reading people's
			  non-verbal communication, discerning feelings)

		to develop:
			* Expose yourself to other points of view and try to respect them.
				=> read accounts of people's lives
				=> browse websites that aren't aimed at your crowd
			* Practice considering other people's point of view.
				=> pick someone and try to get into their head
					- what's important to them?
					- what motivates them?
					- what would they like to talk about? what
					  wouldn't they want to hear about?
			* Basic needs:
				- to be liked, respected; feel important to friends; be
				  in the loop; feel interesting or entertaining,
				  appreciated & acknowledged, normal, understood;
				  to be given the benefit of the doubt; to not be embarrassed

			* Get in touch with own feelings
				Out of touch with feelings:
					- over-emphasized rationality
					- learned to repress while growing up
					- strong emotions upset & confuse => pushed away

				Suggestions:
					- "How am I feeling right now?"
					- Add more nuance to identifying emotion
						(sad => disappointed/regretful/dejected/...)
					- Find out if I'm using tactics to avoid/bypass emotions
						(distracting by work, intelectualizing,
						substances, ...)
					- Is there some emotion beneath this one?
						(sad emotions covered up by anger, worry)
					- Don't push away emotions

			* Practice reading emotions
				identify emotion (movie/TV show; context; people-watch)

			* Get more comfortable showing support and concern
			* Learn when it's appropriate to play along on the surface
