	- being interesting is about introducing people to new things
		- have knowledge others would want, but don't have yet
		- be the real deal and live a fun life => gather experience and knowledge
	- try new things, expose yourself to new ideas, listen to new music
	- don't do the same things week after week
	- learn to present what you have to say in an engaging manner
	- develop an instinct for the things people want to hear about
	- foster your uniqueness
	- don't feel entitled to being perceived as interesting
