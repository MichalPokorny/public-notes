<http://www.succeedsocially.com/loosenup> :note """
too uptight (too judgemental at people, look down at silly/immature behavior, thinking they always have to be controlled & proper & well-behaved)

heart:
	* rigid, unrealistic standards about how people should act
	* too touchy, tending to overreact when things go wrong

- interrupting/talking over each other
- uptight people see themselves as important, refined, intelligent adults
- care a bit too much about following the rules & think others should too
- accept you can't control everything
