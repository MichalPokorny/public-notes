("Hedonistic Imperative") :quote """
	The earlier arguments of this paper have, I hope, substantiated
	the claim that what may be dubbed "Peripheralism" is hopelessly less effective than the
	direct biological route in achieving what we're not always wittingly after. Environmental
	reformism of any conceivable kind fails, and will invariably fail, to overturn the hedonic
	treadmill. We've tried it for ages, and it doesn't work. Given our (sometimes) nominally
	disguised purposes, and given that irrationalism is not a live option, the only
	countervailing reasons against pursuing the biological program's rational strategic course
	of action will be moral considerations.
