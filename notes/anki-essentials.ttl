		Ctu verzi 1.0

		Other popular SRS (spaced repetition software): Mnemosyne,  :under :read .Metric, iSRS

		Interesting study options:
			Timeboxing study sessions: limit time for session, then show a notification
			Force Anki to wait the full step length
			New cards first, last, or mixed
			Don't display the number of scheduled cards
			Don't display the review intervals

		Filtered decks are just filters. The filters can be re-run, then emptied.

		When a card lapses, the interval after it's re-learned
		may be bigger -- inherited from before lapsing.

		"Weekly" study option group:
		maximum reviews/day: 5, maximum interval: 7 days
		(inspiring quotes, cool images, etc.)

		Meet people before meeting them - Anki deck.
