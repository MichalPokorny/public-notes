		Ctu verzi 1.0

		Other popular SRS (spaced repetition software): Mnemosyne,  :under :read .Metric, iSRS

		Interesting study options:
			Timeboxing study sessions: limit time for session, then show a notification
			Force Anki to wait the full step length
			New cards first, last, or mixed
			Don't display the number of scheduled cards
			Don't display the review intervals

		Filtered decks are just filters. The filters can be re-run, then emptied.

		When a card lapses, the interval after it's re-learned
		may be bigger -- inherited from before lapsing.

		"Weekly" study option group:
		maximum reviews/day: 5, maximum interval: 7 days
		(inspiring quotes, cool images, etc.)

		Meet people before meeting them - Anki deck.

		Mnemonic Major System:
		0: z, s, soft c (sound like the start of "zero")
		1: d, t (single down stroke, sound similar)
		2: n (two down strokes)
		3: m (three down strokes)
		4: r (sounds like four)
		5: l (the roman for 50)
		6: j, soft "g" (also: sh, soft "ch", dg, zh)
		7: k (also: hard c, hard g, hard "ch", q, qu) - a "k" looks like
		two 7 stuck together, the rest sound similar
		8: f, v, th - a fancy f looks a bit like an 8, v sounds like f
		9: b, p: both look like flipped nines

		Vowels can be used as "fillers".

		Do this for 100 words from 0 to 99 => memorize by series of AV images
		(for better memorization: hand-draw 100 pictures)

		Put in motivations, quotes, major events in world history,
		long-term goals -- "shit that gets me motivated"

		Image Occlusion 2.0: easily creates occluded images
