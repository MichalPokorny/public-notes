	Chapter: meets to discuss, spreads EA message
	Goals: indicators: e.g. GWWC pledges, additional donated money, significant career plan changes, etc.

	Find core group and decide to launch;
	Plan a large public lecture as a launch event

	Get professors to offer class credit for attending EA talk.

	Launch event: welcome speech by core organizer, the talk, Q&A, brief
	closing speech, post-talk mingling

	Keeping the momentum from the launch event is crucial.
	Audience intraction is valuable.

	Engage with the media.
	Taking GWWC pledge reflects well on my institution - speak with
	institution's press office to share it with the media (local
	newspapers).

	TODO: Talk to GWWC to ask for Czechs who took the GWWC pledge.
	(GWWC chapter coordinator)

	Create a checklist of what needs to happen.
	Have ushers.
	Print surveys in advance - contact info, feedback.
		(Google Drive has survey templates)
	Submit an event report to central GWWC (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?hl=en_US&formkey=dDk1bkFZWkpQSGFTS3BpWk9XWEFRZWc6MQ#gid=0)
	Call or e-mail the people THE NEXT DAY.

	Fliers are not worth the time.

	Estimate: the average person who joins GWWC will donate ~$70k to most
	effective charities == approximately 40 lives saved.

	We overestimate how much an income change will affect our well-being.

	Salary >$40k, then in richest 1% of world population.

	Deworming: ~$0.12-$0.5 per person
	Parasitic worms infect 1 billion people worldwide.
	Someone suffering from a hookworm infection has a 40% lower expected income.

	People often suffer from cognitive dissonance, so they can be hostile to
	the suggestion that they could improve the way they act.
