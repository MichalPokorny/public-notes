	Chapter: meets to discuss, spreads EA message
	Goals: indicators: e.g. GWWC pledges, additional donated money, significant career plan changes, etc.

	Find core group and decide to launch;
	Plan a large public lecture as a launch event

	Get professors to offer class credit for attending EA talk.

	Launch event: welcome speech by core organizer, the talk, Q&A, brief
	closing speech, post-talk mingling

	Keeping the momentum from the launch event is crucial.
	Audience intraction is valuable.

	Engage with the media.
	Taking GWWC pledge reflects well on my institution - speak with
	institution's press office to share it with the media (local
	newspapers).

	Create a checklist of what needs to happen.
	Have ushers.
	Print surveys in advance - contact info, feedback.
		(Google Drive has survey templates)
	Submit an event report to central GWWC (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?hl=en_US&formkey=dDk1bkFZWkpQSGFTS3BpWk9XWEFRZWc6MQ#gid=0)
	Call or e-mail the people THE NEXT DAY.

	Fliers are not worth the time.

	Estimate: the average person who joins GWWC will donate ~$70k to most
	effective charities == approximately 40 lives saved.

	We overestimate how much an income change will affect our well-being.

	Salary >$40k, then in richest 1% of world population.

	Deworming: ~$0.12-$0.5 per person
	Parasitic worms infect 1 billion people worldwide.
	Someone suffering from a hookworm infection has a 40% lower expected income.

	People often suffer from cognitive dissonance, so they can be hostile to
	the suggestion that they could improve the way they act.

	Be positive. Don't talk about how huge the problem is.
	Focus on positive side: how much, in ABSOLUTE terms, can you do to help.
	Be enthusiastic.

	Be relativist. Don't use moral language. Just explain the opportunity.

	To overcome objections:
		Acknowledge the truth in the objection.
		Repeat the objection.
		Check for understanding at the end.
		Address further objections.
		Redirect the conversation to something useful afterwards (use
		open-ended questions to get the person thinking).

	Running effective commitee meetings:
		Have someone lead the meeting. Not necessarily the president.

	How to delegate well:
		Delegate often and wisely.
		Give specific-enough instructions to people.
		Bundle unglamorous tasks with glamorous tasks.
		Create and assign official positions.
		Deliver tasks as requests rather than instructions. Announce successes and jobs well done.

	Interacting with the media:
		Use university's "media office", or get help from GWWC's press officer (sam.deere@givingwhatwecan.org)
		Produce a "news release".
		Send to interested journalists.

	Do mock interviews.

	Activities and events:
		- Giving Games (http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/Giving-Games)
		- Speakers events/panel discussions
		- Informal discussions
		- Socials
		- Fundraisers
		- Letter-writing / political lobbying
		- Delivering talks at workplaces, old high schools, etc.
		- Film / documentary screenings
		- Training sessions
		- Having stalls at relevant fairs
		- Attending relevant networking events
		- Research week - coordinated with central GWWC
