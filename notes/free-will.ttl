	Consider what it would take to actually have
	free will. You would need to be aware of all the
	factors that determine your thoughts and actions,
	and you would need to have complete control
	over those factors. But there is a paradox here
	that vitiates the very notion of freedom—for what
	would influence the influences? More influen-
	ces? None of these adventitious mental states are
	the real you. You are not controlling the storm,
	and you are not lost in it. You are the storm.

Yes, you can decide to go on a diet—and we
know a lot about the variables that will enable
you to stick to it—but you cannot know why you
were finally able to adhere to this discipline when
all your previous attempts failed. You might have
a story to tell about why things were different this
time around, but it would be nothing more than
a post hoc description of events that you did not
control.""" ;
