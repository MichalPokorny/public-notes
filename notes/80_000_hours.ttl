	6 key ingredients for a dream job

	focusing on well-paid jobs and easy jobs is overrated
		- money is not that important for happiness
		- re. stress: sweet spot is where demands match abilities

	5 key ingredients of wellbeing (Seligman, founder of positive psychology):
		- positive emotion (feeling happy day-to-day)
		- engagement (challenging, absorbing tasks)
		- relationships (supportive friends and family)
		- meaning (higher purpose)
		- achievement

	6 key factors:
		- work that's engaging
			- freedom to decide how to perform work
			- clear tasks
			- variety in types of task
			- feedback
		- work that helps others
		- work you're good at
		- work with supportive colleagues
		- lack of major negatives (long commute, very long hours, etc)
		- work that fits your personal life

	get good at something that helps others

	TODO: score career options on each factor
	TODO: when have you been most fulfilled in the past?
	TODO: what would you spend your life doing if you die in 10 years?

	TODO: learn marketing and management - almost all orgs need those

	Safest jobs involve creativity: high-level problem solving, social
	intelligence: management, social work, engineering, ...

	TODO: develop data science skills
	TODO: learn marketing and sales
	TODO: learn growth hacking
	TODO: build and pursue opportunities for investing in flexible career capital

	TODO: take care of the basics: sleep, diet, exercise, mental health,
	supportive friendships

	TODO: Learning how to learn in Coursera

	TODO: Go investigate - try out careers, research
		- try your 2-4 long-term options over the next 2-5 years
		- consider "wildcards": living in a weird country, an unusual
		  side project, etc.
