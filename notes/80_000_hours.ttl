	6 key ingredients for a dream job

	focusing on well-paid jobs and easy jobs is overrated
		- money is not that important for happiness
		- re. stress: sweet spot is where demands match abilities

	5 key ingredients of wellbeing (Seligman, founder of positive psychology):
		- positive emotion (feeling happy day-to-day)
		- engagement (challenging, absorbing tasks)
		- relationships (supportive friends and family)
		- meaning (higher purpose)
		- achievement

	6 key factors:
		- work that's engaging
			- freedom to decide how to perform work
			- clear tasks
			- variety in types of task
			- feedback
		- work that helps others
		- work you're good at
		- work with supportive colleagues
		- lack of major negatives (long commute, very long hours, etc)
		- work that fits your personal life

	get good at something that helps others

	TODO: score career options on each factor
	TODO: when have you been most fulfilled in the past?
	TODO: what would you spend your life doing if you die in 10 years?

	TODO: learn marketing and management - almost all orgs need those

	Safest jobs involve creativity: high-level problem solving, social
	intelligence: management, social work, engineering, ...

	TODO: develop data science skills
	TODO: learn marketing and sales
	TODO: learn growth hacking
	TODO: build and pursue opportunities for investing in flexible career capital

	TODO: take care of the basics: sleep, diet, exercise, mental health,
	supportive friendships

	TODO: Learning how to learn in Coursera

	TODO: Go investigate - try out careers, research
		- try your 2-4 long-term options over the next 2-5 years
		- consider "wildcards": living in a weird country, an unusual
		  side project, etc.

	--- PAGE 130 ---

	1. Make a big list of options
		- write down initial list, including roles and problem to focus on
		- generate lots more ideas
			- what if money were no object?
			- how to use most valuable career capital?
			- can I combine options?
			- what if nothing of these is available?
			- can my connections give me more options?
	2. Rank your options
		- start with initial guess
		- score 1..5 impact, personal fit, other elements of job satisfaction, other factors
		- cut down to shortlist
			- eliminate dominated options, options very poor on one factor
	3. Key uncertainties
		- which information could most easily change my ranking?
	4. Initial research
		- cheap tests first
			- Google
			- speak to someone from the area
			- speak to people who work there, read 1-2 books
			- small project (e.g., 1-4 weeks)
			- consider a 2-24 month commitment
		- orer options well
			- explore BEFORE grad study, not after
			- try other alternatives BEFORE academia
			- put reversible options first
			- choose options that let you experiment
			- try on the side

	A/B/Z plan:
		A: the ideal scenario.
			Option 1: work out how to get to long-term option, if
			reasonably confident.
			Determine the best route; did someone manage to get
			there unusually fast?

			Option 2: If uncertain about medium-term option,
			plan to try out top 2-4 in the next few years.

			Option 3: If very uncertain, do more research and
			build career capital in the meantime.

		B: the nearby alternatives
			What to do if A doesn't work out.
			Ask: What's not likely to work in Plan A?
			What obstacles are likely? Make 2-3 alternatives.

		Z: Temporary fallback
			If everything goes wrong, to put myself back on my
			feet. (Imagine the worst possible downside - that
			makes it less scary.)

	TODO: Commit to reviewing your plan to avoid status quo bias and
	sunk cost fallacy (80k career review tool); try to justify thoughts
	to a friend to avoid bias
		At least once per year

	TODO: Make a list of signs that would tell me I'm on the wrong path

	TODO: Schedule an afternoon to work through http://80k.link/HWC

	Finding a job:
		Stage 1: Leads
			- need LOTS of leads
			- don't send resumes to lots of places - use connections
		Stage 2: Conversions
			Tip: Do free work to impress
				- find out what will you do in the role
				- research the company
				- spend a weekend putting together a solution

			On interviews:
				- ask questions to understand their challenges
				- focus of what's most impressive
				- prepare answers to most likely questions
		Stage 3: Negotiation
			TODO: Actually consider doing this!
				- donation matching
				- more flexible hours, work remotely,
				  learn skills, etc.
			- look for win-wins
	- never job hunt again - use referrals, gain connections, be great at your job

	TODO: "implementation intention" - write down *when* you will do something

	11 ways to put yourself into a better position:
		1. take care of the basics (enough sleep, eat right, maintain friendships)
		2. look after your mental health
		3. take advantage of positive psychology
			- rate happiness at the end of each day (moodscope.com)
			- gratitude journaling, 3 per day; the gratitude visit
			- using signature strengths (take viacharacter.org/www/The‐Survey, use one of top 5 per day)
			- learn basic CBT (simple exercise: ABCD)
			- mindfulness (headspace.com)
			- do something kind each day
			- practice active constructive responding (gostrengths.com/what‐is‐active‐and‐constructive‐responding)
			- adopt the growth mindset
		4. save money
