	Ra: glitch in intuition: idealize vagueness and despise clarity
		universal gods: glorious, mighty, holy, ...: no specific characteristics except wonderfulness
		stockpiling money, accolades, awards, ...
		wanting "bestness"

	examples of this quality: OpenAI, Google, Enron before collapse
	Note: Effective Altruism -- seems shiny, full of best and brightest
		==> appealing in a very Ra-flavored way

	Ra: radiant white light, smoothness

	Work for prestige, but not merely for money or intrinsic interest
		==> being influenced by Ra
		(trying to be an insider in a prestigious institution)

	Ra: gross & degrading to pay a cleaner, less so to hire maid service
		institutions can have authority and legitimacy that humans cannot

	Humans who serve institutions serve Ra.

	Ra causes unbounded over-caution (throwing away huge value to reduce already small risks)
		SACRIFICING EXCESS VALUE TO INSTITUTIONS YOU VIEW AS MORE
		LEGITIMATE THAN YOURSELF

	**Ra defends itself with vagueness, confusion, incoherence, and the anger.**

	To Ra, consistent thought is suspect.
		Ra likes vagueness, mental fog, avoidance, ...

	Ra wants worshippers to be always available (recruitable); to have
	resistance is wicked.

	Ra: smooth, soft vagueness that collapses into angry nihilism

	Symptom of Ra: being offended or upset when friends/allies are NOT doing
	things associated with power and status.
		Insecurity and anger at the sight of someone doing their own
		thing!

	Ra causes persistent brain fog/confusion, especially around economic
	thinking, cost-benefit analysis, quantitative estimates.

	When Ra is active, you'll see a persistent disposition, in otherwise
	intelligent people, to misunderstand trade or negotiation scenarios as
	dominance/submission scenarios.

	Blogging is very anti-Ra.

	Horus is not Ra.  Horus likes organization, clarity, intelligence,
	money, excellence, and power — and these things are genuinely valuable.
	If you want to accomplish big goals, it is perfectly rational to seek
	them, because they’re force multipliers.  Pursuit of force multipliers
	— that is, pursuit of power — is not inherently Ra.  There is nothing
	Ra-like, for instance, about noticing that software is a fully general
	force multiplier and trying to invest in or make better software.
	Ra comes in when you start admiring force multipliers for no specific
	goal, just because they’re shiny.

	Ra is hard to pin down, but vulnerable to open communication and
	introspection.  If you can talk and think about what you want, or how
	you feel, or why you believe what you do, and you don’t dodge
	the question, Ra will dissolve like mist. The illusion of smooth
	impersonal perfection doesn’t survive long after you get to know
	particular human beings. The subjective impression of something being
	like a vague glowy ball of positive affect doesn’t survive explicit
	discussion or analysis.
