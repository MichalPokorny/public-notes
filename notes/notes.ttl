		* for every 25% increase in problem complexity, there is a 100% increase in
		  solution complexity
		* the two biggest causes of project failure are poor estimation and unstable
		  requirements
		* if more than 20-25% of a component has to be revised, it's better to start
		  from scratch

		60-90% of errors can be removed by careful inspection
		most of value comes from first reader and first 1 hour
		anything more is not economical
		a few hundreds of lines of code

		every change ought to be sized small

		a system reflects the organizational structure that built it
			(originally joke, turns out to be true)

		physical distance between developers has no impact on post-release fault rate
		organizational distance matters

		most commonly used code metrics strongly correlate with lines of code

crony beliefs vs. merit beliefs;

crony: belief motivated by social incentives to believe it
	- abstract and impractical (not actionable)
	- benefit of the doubt (stacked deck in its favor)
	- conspicuousness -- the belief is advertised; the greater the urge to
		talk about it, the more likely it is to be a crony
	- overconfidence
	- reluctance to bet (some parts of our psyche know it's unlikely to be true)
	- storng emotions -- *proud* of belief, *anguish* over changing, *anger*
		at being challenged/criticized

crony belief examples:
	- climate change
	- political beliefs ("gun control will save lives")
	- ethical beliefs
	- beliefs about the self

in belief domain:
	if I try to purge crony beliefs WITHOUT fixing the social ecosystem,
	I will have trouble: A) lose cronies and lose socially, B) suffer
	cognitive dissonance by protecting cronies
