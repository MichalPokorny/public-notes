	Translating "have to" to "choose to":
		1. write down "have to"'s
		2. acknowledge choice
		3. get in touch with intention ("I choose to do X because Y.")

	money, approval, escaping punishment, avoiding shame, guilt, satisfying
	a sense of duty:: be conscious of these actions, be aware of the price
	you're paying for them.

	anger: comes from blame & judgement
		To motivate by guilt, mix up stimulus and response.
		What other people do is never a cause for how we feel.

		"alarm clock": a need is not being met

	not "I am angry because they ..."; "I am angry because I".

	4 options when hearing a difficult message:
		- blame ourselves
		- blame others
		- sense our own feelings and needs
		- sense others' feelings and needs

	As soon as people think that they have done something wrong, they will
	not be fully apprehending our pain.
