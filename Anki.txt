imported file can also set the Tags field - TODO -- I want that.

By default, if the file you are importing has a first field that matches one of
the existing notes in your collection and that existing note is the same type
as the type you’re importing, the existing note’s other fields will be updated
based on content of the imported file.

collection.anki2; audio and images: in collection.media folder

ensure import-wikidata works

to change field replacement tags:
	{{=<% %>=}}
	<%latex field%>
