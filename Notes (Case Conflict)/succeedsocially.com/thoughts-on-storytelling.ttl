<http://www.succeedsocially.com/storytelling> :note """
	- storytelling is relatively rare: most things that happen in life
		aren't really out of the ordinary or story-worthy
	- know why you want tot tell the story
	- ask if it really needs to be a story (not just a few-sentence abstract)
	- be careful about:
		- dreams, when you got really drunk, diets/fitness programs,
		  squabbles, venting, sexual conquest, travel "stories" that are
		  really bragging, ...
	- if audience is not interested or are waiting for their turn, cut it short.
	- if the story is longer, get some sort of permission
	- start with a hook ("So I met the strangest person last Friday...")
	- be succint, don't go off tangent; say as little as you need to establish the scene
	- if you're in the story, play up your foibles & human side
