value of 1 life: 20-30 DALYs

EA:
 * evaluation issues: advocacy, meta, far future, ... not verifiable by experiments
	* modeling, Bayesian stuff
 * risk aversion?
 * time discounting
	* unethical by itself; double counting of probability discounting
 * supporting locally:
	* only if you have sufficient comparative advantage in cause selection
	  and/or marginal utility

$800 = 1 dead child

TODOs:
	Julia Galef
	Brian Tomasik
	switch to all-beef => reduce moral footprint by ~99%

	Beyond Meat: vegetarian fake chicken strips
	animal equality: 11 animal lives saved per dollar

neglectedness: compare marginal costs
cancer: 8.2M deaths/year, 7.6% QALYs lost
malaria: 3.3% QALYs lost

social problems are big --> additional resources diminish in value very slowly

assessing risk of death: micromort
	(3.5 hours of unconsciousness after 1 hour of driving a motorcycle)
