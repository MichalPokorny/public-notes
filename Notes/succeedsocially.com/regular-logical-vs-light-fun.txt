two modes: Regular Logical Mode, and Light Fun Mode

success:
	logical mode: learning something new, connecting with someone, getting
		to know someone better, having an interesting conversation
	light fun mode: having fun, feeling good, coming out feeling closer to
		your friends, adventures
occurrences:
	logical mode: work, day-to-day life, 1-on-1 discussion, quiet evening at
		home
	light fun mode: parties, lively group meals, bars and clubs
participants:
	logical mode: friends who know each other, people getting to know each
		other, family
	light fun mode: joking around, acquaintances, friends of friends
getting along with other people:
	logical mode: whether you have rapport, common interests, can have a
	good discussion
	light fun mode: how much fun can you have with each other
personality revealed:
	regular logical mode: 'normal', regular self
	light fun mode: excuses for 'playing a character' (alcohol / caught up
	in the moment)
reaction to people in the other mode:
	regular logical: hyper, loud, unfocused, obnoxious
	light fun: boring, uptight
benefits for shier, more cerebral people:
	regular logical: their element
	light fun: less serious => might do better if playing a character
pitfalls for shier, more cerebral people:
	regular logical: too focused on topic, ignore people we're with, can
	ignore human element
	light fun: too inhibited to function in this mindset, annoyed at
	everyone, over-stimulated, knock to self-esteem

where intellectual, serious types can go wrong:
	* being one-sided and only comfortable in logical mode
	* frustrated with people in fun mode
	* TRYING TO SHOEHORN INTERACTIONS INTO LOGICAL MODE FRAMEWORK (E.G.,
	  TRYING TO TALK POLITICS)
	* LOSING CONFIDENCE IN ABILITY TO RELATE TO PEOPLE & LIKABILITY BECAUSE
	  THEY CAN'T RELATE TO PEOPLE IN FUNMODE
	* RESENT PEOPLE IN FUNMODE
	* UNDERDEVELOPMENT IN THRIVING IN FUNMODE

=> accept that there's nothing wrong with wanting to have fun / act non-serious
=> realize one mode isn't better than the other
=> go with the flow
