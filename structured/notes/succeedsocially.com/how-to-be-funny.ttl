	:title "How to Be Funny"
	:note """
	topic: being spontaneously witty in social situations
	- humor can be a double-edged sword
	- humor pops into your head fully formed
	- trying to be funny all the time isn't a good thing
		- someone can laugh at something BUT STILL NOT LIKE IT OVERALL
		- people might laugh at antics/jokes, but they'd prefer not to
		hear them
	- people assume sense of humor reflects personality
		- be aware of the impression your jokes make on people
	- learn to listen to instincts
		- "Don't say that, it's not really that funny."
		- "Say your comment quickly, before the moment passes."
		- "You've waited too long. Don't say it now."
		- "Keep quiet. This will offend people."
	- don't imitate other people's sense of humor - unnatural
	- pay attention to reactions you get! (you may not be as funny as you think)
	- be comfortable with mini-failure ("Yeah, that one was pretty lame, wasn't it?")
