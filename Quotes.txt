death is the sound of distant thunder at a picnic

be yourself. everyone else is taken.

that is not dead which can eternal lie, and with strange eons even death may die.

lide nelituji toho, co udelali, ale toho, co neudelali (Philip Zimbardo)

Non est salvatori salvator, neque defensori dominus, nec pater, nec mater, nihil supernum. -- Godric Griffindor, 1202 CE

	When Kurt Vonnegut suggested that you stop once in a while to say,
	"If this isn't nice, I don't know what is." He was giving you the best
